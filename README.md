# Tic-Tac-Toe-Website
Juvenile tic tac toe game

This is my second quick project on javascript. With this project not only did I further my knowledge with javascript but also learned about how display works. Specifically display:flex. I did require some help for the "X" and "O" code as it wasn't working as I intended it but overall I did gain some insight into the problem. It was a great project and I got more to come.
